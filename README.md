👋 Hi, I’m @lucasjdc

👀 I’m interested in exploring new technologies, building cool projects, and contributing to open-source communities.

🌱 I’m currently learning about machine learning, web development, and cloud computing.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that make a positive impact and push the boundaries of what's possible in technology.

📫 You can reach me via email at lucasjpdc@gmail.com or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucasjdc/).

Let's innovate and create together!
